\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
Hi there. My name is Jackson Goldberg. I am a senior here at chapman University and I am taking programming languages. I like playing chess. Enjoy reading my report.

\section{Homework}\label{homework}

\subsection{Week 1}

I have added my program into this github repo. It is a simple python program that loops infinatly until a and b are equal.
I ran it with python 3 and manually input 9 and 33 yeilding the answer 3.

\subsection{Week 2}
This week we were tasked with creating simple recursive programs in huskall. These are my solutions for all of the assigned functions. These functions can also be found in a huskell
file titled "Main.hs".
\begin{lstlisting}
  -- Takes a list of char and returns a list of char. This works by assinging the element at odd positional values of a list into an empty list using the zip function which is what it returns.
  select_evens :: [[a]] -> [[a]]
  select_evens xs = [x | (x,i) <- zip xs [0..], odd i]

  -- Example:
  select_evens ["a","b","c","d","e"] =
              [] : (select_evens["b","c","d","e]) = 
           ["b"] : (select_evens ["c","d","e"]) = 
           ["b"] : (select_evens ["d","e"]) = 
           ["b","d"] : (select_evens ["e"])
           ["b","d"] : (select_evens []) =
           ["b","d"]

\end{lstlisting}
I referenced \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49741305/how-to-pick-elements-in-even-index-and-odd-index}{this}.
\begin{lstlisting}
  -- Same logic as above just assignes based on even possition.
  select_odds :: [[a]] -> [[a]]
  select_odds xs = [x | (x,i) <- zip xs [0..], even i]

  -- Example:
  select_odds ["a","b","c","d","e"] = 
           ["a"] : (select_odds["b","c","d","e]) = 
           ["a"] : (select_odds ["c","d","e"]) = 
       ["a","c"] : (select_odds ["d","e"]) = 
       ["a","c"] : (select_odds ["e"])
  ["a","c", "e"] : (select_odds []) =
  ["a","c", "e"]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
  -- Uses the filter to function to create a list of all matching elements to the ones provided.
     If the length is greater then 0 the its a member.
  member :: Int -> [Int] -> IO Bool
  member x li= do
    let xs = filter(== x) li
    if length xs == 0
        then 
            return (False)
        else do
            return(True)
    
  -- Example: 
  member 2 [5,2,6] =
  1 = filter(== 2) li
  if length xs == 0
        else do
          return(True)
  True
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
  -- Uses ++ to concatinate lists.
  append :: [Int] -> [Int] -> [Int]
  append l1 l2 = l1 ++ l2 

  --Example:
  append [1,2] [3,4,5] = 
    [1,2] ++ [3,4,5] =
  [1,2,3,4,5]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
  -- Recursively assigns element to back of new list, creating a reverse list.
  revert :: [Int] -> [Int]
  revert [] = []
  revert (x:xs) = revert xs ++ [x]

  --Example:
  revert [1,2,3] = 
     [3]: revert[1,2] =
   [3,2]: revert[1] =
   [3,2,1]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
  -- Compares two strings using <=.
  less_equal :: [Int] -> [Int] -> IO Bool
  less_equal l1 l2 = do
      if last l1 <= last l2
          then 
              return (True)
          else do
               return (False)
  --Example:
  less_equal [1,2,3] [2,3,2] = 
  3 > 2
  False
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Week 3}

This week we were tasked with finishing the hanoi file supplied to us. The full file can be found 
in Hanoi.txt.
Hanoi is used 31 times in the file. 
You can express this as formula because it doesn't matter the starting blocks since the process will always be the exact same.
you will always need to reduce to the highest block so the number is nonconsiquental. There are many cool visuals of this online which show what is looks like using a graphical interpritation. There is a simple break down for however many N you have. 

\subsection{Week 4}
This week we worked with context free grammers and parse trees. Part one can be found \href {https://github.com/jacgoldberg/Programming-Lang/blob/main/Note%20Sep%2025%2C%202022.pdf}{here}, part 2 can be found 
\href {https://github.com/jacgoldberg/Programming-Lang/blob/main/Note%20Sep%2025%2C%202022%20(2).pdf} {here}.

\section{Project}

Introductory remarks ...

The following structure should be suitable for most practical projects. 

\subsection{Specification}
\subsection{Prototype}
\subsection{Documentation}
\subsection{Critical Appraisal}

\ldots

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

(approx 400 words)

In the conclusion, I want a critical reflection on the content of the course. Step back from the technical details. How does the course fit into the wider world of programming languages and software engineering?
